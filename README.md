# CNN-and-Tensor-Factorization-for-MVMT
This is about the Model I have designed which combines the power of tensor factorization and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Multi-View Multi-Task Learning. The model has been trained on FOX dataset and illustrated superb performance. This work is done when I am working as an intern at Chinese Academy of Science, Institution of Automation. (CASIA)
